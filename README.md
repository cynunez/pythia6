# pythia6
all our pythia6 flavors

pythia6: original from root (https://root.cern.ch/download/pythia6.tar.gz), updated with latest pythia6 from the pythia website (http://www.hepforge.org/archive/pythia6/pythia-6.4.28.f.gz)

pythia6-lhapdf: the above but use lhapdf pdf's, the original subroutines PDFSET, STRUCTM and STRUCTP were renamed to *OLD in the pythia6 source so a diff doesn't produce a lot of output

pythiaeRHIC: pythia with radiative corrections from radgen by the EIC steering group
